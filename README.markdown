==== To Do ====
* Use AJAX for create/destroy section, new/create/edit/update/destroy link
* Use TinyMCE for page/section text.
* Get rid of stale 'Saving ...' messages (Partly solved through ajax notices).
* Use #saving, #loading dividers for relevant notices.
* Add image to sections
* Add contact form.

==== Wishlist ====
* Event calendar
* Date countdown
* Drag-drop files/images locally to upload.
